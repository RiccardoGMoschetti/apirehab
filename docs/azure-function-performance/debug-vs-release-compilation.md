# Performance of debug vs release compilations

Ah, the classic blunder that every developer has experienced at least once in their professional journey. You excitedly deploy your software to the production environment, only to realize with horror that you've compiled it in debug mode. Oopsie daisy!  
But hey, is it really as catastrophic as it sounds? Let's delve into the peculiar world of debug vs release compilations and see what mischief awaits us.

_The Dreaded Debug Compilation_

First, let us try to understand the differences between the _debug_ and _release_ modes. A comprehensive answer to this question can be found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/367884/what-is-the-difference-between-debug-and-release-in-visual-studio/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>. In debug mode, debug information is added to the compiled package, including the PDB files, and fewer optimizations are performed.

## Windows

The maximum number of requests per second remains the same between the debug and release modes.

   <th colspan="4"><font size="+1">Maximum requests per second</font></th>
   <tr><td>Tier</td><td><span style="color:darkGreen; font-weight:bold">Good Performance</span></td><td><span style="color:darkOrange; font-weight:bold">Mediocre Performance</span></td><td><span style="color:darkRed; font-weight:bold">Any performance</span></td></tr>
   <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>95th perc. &lt; 100ms</td><td>95th perc. < 1000ms</td><td>(any 95th perc)</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Windows P2v3 <em>debug mode</em></td><td>825</td><td>1025</td><td>1050</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Windows P2v3 <em>release mode </em></td><td>825</td><td>1025</td><td>1050</td></tr>
   
</table>

Additionally, both CPU and memory utilization show no significant differences. In fact, the _debug_ mode demonstrated (surprisingly) slightly improved memory efficiency.
